# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Opinion-Feature-Extraction-of-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment analysis or opinion mining can be described as study of public opinion on politics, sports, products, movies or any other area of interest. Because of social media access, it has become rather easy to give out opinion on anything and it has made easier for the researchers to work because of immense amount of data. Sentiment analysis is a subset of Natural Language Processing, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. In this project I have performed opinion mining of Movie reviews on Rotten Tomatoes Dataset using three algorithms; Logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Decision Tree. This project serves as a comparison between mentioned three algorithms, we have focus on the training set as the main objective to present the retrieval of optimal probability thresholds using the ROC Curve and results are further compared using confusion matrix.
